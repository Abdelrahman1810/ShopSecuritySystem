# Shop Security System

This is an Arduino project that uses the MFRC522 RFID reader module, PIR motion sensor, magnetic door sensor, 2 buzzers and an LCD screen to create a shop security system. When the system detects an unauthorized access, it triggers the alarm system, sounds two buzzers, and displays a warning message on the LCD screen. The alarm will continue to sound until an authorized RFID card is presented to the RFID reader module.

## Requirements

- Arduino Uno or any compatible board
- MFRC522 RFID reader module
- PIR motion sensor
- Magnetic door sensor
- 2 buzzers
- 16x2 LCD screen (I2C e.g.)
- green LEDC
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

- RFID reader module:
  - SDA pin to Arduino digital pin 10
  - SCK pin to Arduino digital pin 13
  - MOSI pin to Arduino digital pin 11
  - MISO pin to Arduino digital pin 12
  - IRQ not connected
  - GND pin to Arduino GND
  - RST pin to Arduino digital pin 9
  - 3.3V pin to Arduino 3.3V

## Libraries

This project uses the following libraries:
- <a href="https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid">MFRC522</a> library GithubCommunity
- <a href="https://github.com/johnrickman/LiquidCrystal_I2C">LiquidCrystal_12C</a> library by Frank de Brabander


## Usage

1. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
2. Connect the components according to the connection diagram.
3. Power up your Arduino board.
4. Present an authorized RFID card to the RFID reader module to arm the system.
5. Test the system by triggering the PIR motion sensor or opening the magnetic door sensor.
6. Present an authorized RFID card to the RFID reader module to disarm the system.

## Customization

You can customize the code to add or remove authorized RFID card IDs. You can also customize the warning messages displayed on the LCD screen and the duration and pattern of the buzzer alarm.

**Note**: When modifying the code, make sure to test the system thoroughly to ensure its reliability and security.
